    <h2> THE GONDOLIERS </h2>
    <h3> ACT I The Piazzetta, Venice </h3>
    <p> Scene.— the Piazzetta, Venice. The Ducal Palace on the right.<br>
        <br>
        Fiametta, Giulia, Vittoria, and other Contadine discovered, each 
        tying a bouquet of roses.<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS OF CONTADINE.<br>
        <br>
        List and learn, ye dainty roses,<br>
        Roses white and roses red, <br>
        Why we bind you into posies <br>
        Ere your morning bloom has fled. <br>
        By a law of maiden's making, <br>
        Accents of a heart that's aching, <br>
        Even though that heart be breaking, <br>
        Should by maiden be unsaid: <br>
        Though they love with love exceeding, <br>
        They must seem to be unheeding— <br>
        Go ye then and do their pleading, <br>
        Roses white and roses red! <br>
        <br>
        FIAMETTA. <br>
        <br>
        Two there are for whom in duty, <br>
        Every maid in Venice sighs— <br>
        Two so peerless in their beauty <br>
        That they shame the summer skies.<br>
        We have hearts for them, in plenty,<br>
        They have hearts, but all too few,<br>
        We, alas, are four-and-twenty!<br>
        They, alas, are only two!<br>
        We, alas!<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS. Alas! <br>
        <br>
        FIA. Are four-and-twenty,<br>
        They, alas!<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS. Alas!<br>
        <br>
        FIA. Are only two.<br>
        <br>
        CHORUS. They, alas, are only two, alas!<br>
        Now ye know, ye dainty roses,<br>
        Roses white and roses red,<br>
        Why we bind you into posies,<br>
        Ere your morning bloom has fled,<br>
        Roses white and roses red!<br>
        <br>
        (During this chorus Antonio, Francesco, Giorgio, and other<br>
        Gondoliers have entered unobserved by the Girls—at first two,<br>
        then two more, then four, then half a dozen, then the remainder<br>
        of the Chorus.)<br>
        <br>
        SOLI.<br>
        <br>
        FRANC. Good morrow, pretty maids; for whom prepare ye<br>
        These floral tributes extraordinary?<br>
        <br>
        FIA. For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri,<br>
        The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.<br>
        <br>
        GIU. They're coming here, as we have heard but lately,<br>
        To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.<br>
        <br>
        ANT. Do all you maidens love them?<br>
        <br>
        ALL. Passionately!<br>
        <br>
        ANT. These gondoliers are to be envied greatly!<br>
        <br>
        GIOR. But what of us, who one and all adore you?<br>
        Have pity on our passion, we implore you!<br>
        <br>
        FIA. These gentlemen must make their choice before you;<br>
        <br>
        VIT. In the meantime we tacitly ignore you.<br>
        <br>
        GIU. When they have chosen two that leaves you plenty—<br>
        Two dozen we, and ye are four-and-twenty.<br>
        <br>
        FIA. and VIT. Till then, enjoy your dolce far niente.<br>
        <br>
        ANT. With pleasure, nobody contradicente!<br>
        <br>
        SONG—ANTONIO and CHORUS.
