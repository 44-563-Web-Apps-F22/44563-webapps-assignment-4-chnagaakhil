    List and learn, ye dainty roses,<br>
    Roses white and roses red, <br>
    Why we bind you into posies <br>
    Ere your morning bloom has fled. <br>
    By a law of maiden's making, <br>
    Accents of a heart that's aching, <br>
    Even though that heart be breaking, <br>
    Should by maiden be unsaid: <br>
    Though they love with love exceeding, <br>
    They must seem to be unheeding— <br>
    Go ye then and do their pleading, <br>
    Roses white and roses red! <br>

    That they shame the summer skies.<br>

    They have hearts, but all too few,<br>
    We, alas, are four-and-twenty!<br>
    They, alas, are only two!<br>
    We, alas!<br>
