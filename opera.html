    <h2> THE GONDOLIERS </h2>
    <h3> ACT I The Piazzetta, Venice </h3>
    <p> Scene.— the Piazzetta, Venice. The Ducal Palace on the right.
    </p>    
    <p>Fiametta, Giulia, Vittoria, and other Contadine discovered, each
        tying a bouquet of roses.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>CHORUS OF CONTADINE.</h4>
    <p>
    List and learn, ye dainty roses,<br>
    Roses white and roses red, <br>
    Why we bind you into posies <br>
    Ere your morning bloom has fled. <br>
    By a law of maiden's making, <br>
    Accents of a heart that's aching, <br>
    Even though that heart be breaking, <br>
    Should by maiden be unsaid: <br>
    Though they love with love exceeding, <br>
    They must seem to be unheeding— <br>
    Go ye then and do their pleading, <br>
    Roses white and roses red! <br>
    </p>
    <h4>FIAMETTA.</h4>
    <p>
    Two there are for whom in duty, <br>
    Every maid in Venice sighs— <br>
    Two so peerless in their beauty <br>
    That they shame the summer skies.<br>
    We have hearts for them, in plenty,<br>
    They have hearts, but all too few,<br>
    We, alas, are four-and-twenty!<br>
    They, alas, are only two!<br>
    We, alas!<br>
    </p>
    <h4>CHORUS.</h4> Alas! <br>
    <h4>FIA.</h4> Are four-and-twenty,<br>
    They, alas!
    <h4>CHORUS.</h4> Alas!<br>
    <h4>FIA.</h4> Are only two.<br>
    <h4>CHORUS.</h4> They, alas, are only two, alas!<br>
    <p>
    Now ye know, ye dainty roses,<br>
    Roses white and roses red,<br>
    Why we bind you into posies,<br>
    Ere your morning bloom has fled,<br>
    Roses white and roses red!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    (During this chorus Antonio, Francesco, Giorgio, and other<br>
    Gondoliers have entered unobserved by the Girls—at first two,<br>
    then two more, then four, then half a dozen, then the remainder<br>
    of the Chorus.)
    </p>
    <h4>SOLI.</h4>
    <h4>FRANC.</h4> Good morrow, pretty maids; for whom prepare ye<br>
    These floral tributes extraordinary?
    <h4>FIA.</h4> For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri,<br>
    The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.
    <h4>GIU.</h4> They're coming here, as we have heard but lately,<br>
    To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.
    <h4>ANT.</h4> Do all you maidens love them?
    <h4>ALL.</h4> Passionately!
    <h4>ANT.</h4> These gondoliers are to be envied greatly!
    <h4>GIOR.</h4> But what of us, who one and all adore you?
    Have pity on our passion, we implore you!
    <h4>FIA.</h4> These gentlemen must make their choice before you;
    <h4>VIT.</h4> In the meantime we tacitly ignore you.
    <h4>GIU.</h4> When they have chosen two that leaves you plenty—<br>
    Two dozen we, and ye are four-and-twenty.
    <h4>FIA.</h4> and <h4>VIT.</h4> Till then, enjoy your dolce far niente.
    <h4>ANT.</h4> With pleasure, nobody contradicente!
    <h4>SONG—ANTONIO and CHORUS.</h4>
    <p>
    For the merriest fellows are we, tra la,<br>
    That ply on the emerald sea, tra la;<br>
    With loving and laughing,<br>
    And quipping and quaffing,<br>
    We're happy as happy can be, tra la—<br>
    With loving and laughing, etc.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    With sorrow we've nothing to do, tra la,<br>
    And care is a thing to pooh-pooh, tra la;<br>
    And Jealousy yellow,<br>
    Unfortunate fellow,<br>
    We drown in the shimmering blue, tra la—<br>
    And Jealousy yellow, etc.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>FIA.</h4> (looking off). See, see, at last they come to make their choice—
    <p>Let us acclaim them with united voice.</p>
    <p>
    (Marco and Giuseppe appear in gondola at back.)
    </p>
    <h4>CHORUS.</h4> (Girls). Hail, hail! gallant gondolieri, ben venuti!<br>
    Accept our love, our homage, and our duty.<br>
    Ben' venuti! ben' venuti!<br>
    <p>
    (Marco and Giuseppe jump ashore—the Girls salute them.)
    </p>
    <h4>DUET—MARCO</h4> and <h4>GIUSEPPE</h4>, with <h4>CHORUS OF GIRLS.</h4>
    <h4>MAR.</h4> and <h4>GIU.</h4> Buon' giorno, signorine!
    <h4>GIRLS.</h4> Gondolieri carissimi! Siamo contadine!
    <h4>MAR.</h4> and <h4>GIU.</h4> (bowing). Servitori umilissimi!
    Per chi questi fiori— Questi fiori bellissimi?
    <h4>GIRLS.</h4> Per voi, bei signori O eccellentissimi!<br>
    <p>
    (The Girls present their bouquets to Marco and Giuseppe, who are<br>
    overwhelmed with them, and carry them with difficulty.)
    </p>
    <h4>MAR.</h4> and <h4>GIU.</h4> (their arms full of flowers). O ciel'! O ciel'!
    <h4>GIRLS.</h4> Buon' giorno, cavalieri!
    <h4>MAR.</h4> and <h4>GIU.</h4> (deprecatingly). Siamo gondolieri.
    <p>(To Fia. and Vit.)</p> Signorina, io t' amo!
    <h4>GIRLS.</h4> (deprecatingly). Contadine siamo.
    <h4>MAR.</h4> and <h4>GIU.</h4> Signorine!
    <h4>GIRLS.</h4> (deprecatingly). Contadine!
    <p>(Curtseying to Mar. and Giu.)</p> Cavalieri.
    <h4>MAR.</h4> and <h4>GIU.</h4> (deprecatingly). Gondolieri! Poveri gondolieri!
    <h4>CHORUS.</h4> Buon' giorno, signorine, etc.
    <h4>DUET—MARCO and GIUSEPPE.</h4>
    <p>
    We're called gondolieri,<br>
    But that's a vagary,<br>
    It's quite honorary<br>
    The trade that we ply.<br>
    For gallantry noted<br>
    Since we were short-coated,<br>
    To beauty devoted,<br>
    Giuseppe\Are Marco and I;<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    When morning is breaking,<br>
    Our couches forsaking,<br>
    To greet their awaking<br>
    With carols we come.<br>
    At summer day's nooning,<br>
    When weary lagooning,<br>
    Our mandolins tuning,<br>
    We lazily thrum.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    When vespers are ringing,<br>
    To hope ever clinging,<br>
    With songs of our singing<br>
    A vigil we keep,<br>
    When daylight is fading,<br>
    Enwrapt in night's shading,<br>
    With soft serenading<br>
    We sing them to sleep.<br>
    </p>
    We're called gondolieri, etc.
    <h4>RECITATIVE—MARCO and GIUSEPPE.</h4>
    <h4>MAR.</h4> And now to choose our brides!
    <h4>GIU.</h4> As all are young and fair,
    And amiable besides,
    <h4>BOTH.</h4> We really do not care
    A preference to declare.
    <h4>MAR.</h4> A bias to disclose
    Would be indelicate—
    <h4>GIU.</h4> And therefore we propose<br>
    To let impartial Fate<br>
    Select for us a mate!<br>
    <h4>ALL.</h4> Viva!
    <h4>GIRLS.</h4> A bias to disclose Would be indelicate—
    <h4>MEN.</h4> But how do they propose To let impartial Fate
    Select for them a mate?
    <h4>GIU.</h4> These handkerchiefs upon our eyes be good enough to
    bind,
    <h4>MAR.</h4> And take good care that both of us are absolutely
    blind;
    <h4>BOTH.</h4> Then turn us round—and we, with all convenient
    despatch,<br>
    Will undertake to marry any two of you we catch!<br>
    <h4>ALL.</h4> Viva!<br>
    They undertake to marry any two of us\them they catch!<br>
    <p>
    (The Girls prepare to bind their eyes as directed.)<br>
    </p>
    <h4>FIA.</h4> (to Marco). Are you peeping?<br>
    Can you see me?<br>
    <h4>MAR.</h4> Dark I'm keeping,
    Dark and dreamy!<br>
    <p>
    (Marco slyly lifts bandage.)<br>
    </p>
    <h4>VIT.</h4> (to Giuseppe). If you're blinded
    Truly, say so<br>
    <h4>GIU.</h4> All right-minded
    Players play so!
    <p>
    (slyly lifts bandage).<br>
    </p>
    <h4>FIA.</h4> (detecting Marco).Conduct shady!<br>
    <p>
    They are cheating!<br>
    Surely they de-<br>
    Serve a beating!<br>
    (replaces bandage).<br>
    </p>
    <h4>VIT.</h4> (detecting Giuseppe). This too much is;<br>
    <p>
    Maidens mocking—<br>
    Conduct such is<br>
    Truly shocking!<br>
    (replaces bandage).<br>
    </p>
    <h4>ALL.</h4> You can spy, sir!<br>
    <p>
    Shut your eye, sir!<br>
    You may use it by and by, sir!<br>
    You can see, sir!<br>
    Don't tell me, sir!<br>
    That will do—now let it be, sir!<br>
    </p>
    <h4>CHORUS OF GIRLS.</h4> My papa he keeps three horses,<br>
    Black, and white, and dapple grey, sir;<br>
    Turn three times, then take your courses,<br>
    Catch whichever girl you may, sir!<br>
    <h4>CHORUS OF MEN.</h4> My papa, etc.<br>
    <p>
    (Marco and Giuseppe turn round, as directed, and try to catch the<br>
    girls. Business of blind-man's buff. Eventually Marco catches<br>
    Gianetta, and Giuseppe catches Tessa. The two girls try to<br>
    escape, but in vain. The two men pass their hands over the<br>
    girls' faces to discover their identity.)<br>
    </p>
    <h4>GIU.</h4> I've at length achieved a capture!<br>
    (Guessing.) This is Tessa! (removes bandage). Rapture,
    rapture!<br>
    <h4>CHORUS.</h4> Rapture, rapture!<br>
    <h4>MAR.</h4> (guessing). To me Gianetta fate has granted!
    (removes bandage).<br>
    Just the very girl I wanted!<br>
    <h4>CHORUS.</h4> Just the very girl he wanted!<br>
    <h4>GIU.</h4> (politely to Mar.). If you'd rather change—<br>
    <h4>TESS.</h4> My goodness!
    This indeed is simple rudeness.<br>
    <h4>MAR.</h4> (politely to Giu.). I've no preference whatever—<br>
    <h4>GIA.</h4> Listen to him! Well, I never!
    (Each man kisses each girl.)<br>
    <h4>GIA.</h4> Thank you, gallant gondolieri!<br>
    <p>
    In a set and formal measure<br>
    It is scarcely necessary<br>
    To express our pleasure.<br>
    Each of us to prove a treasure,<br>
    Conjugal and monetary,<br>
    Gladly will devote our leisure,<br>
    Gay and gallant gondolieri.<br>
    Tra, la, la, la, la, la, etc.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>TESS.</h4> Gay and gallant gondolieri,<br>
    <p>
    Take us both and hold us tightly,<br>
    You have luck extraordinary;<br>
    We might both have been unsightly!<br>
    If we judge your conduct rightly,<br>
    'Twas a choice involuntary;<br>
    Still we thank you most politely,<br>
    Gay and gallant gondolieri!<br>
    Tra, la, la, la, la, la, etc.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>CHORUS</h4> OF Thank you, gallant gondolieri;<br>
    <h4>GIRLS.</h4> In a set and formal measure,<br>
    <p>
    It is scarcely necessary<br>
    To express our pleasure.<br>
    Each of us to prove a treasure<br>
    Gladly will devote our leisure,<br>
    Gay and gallant gondolieri!<br>
    Tra, la, la, la, la, la, etc.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>ALL.</h4> Fate in this has put his finger—<br>
    <p>
    Let us bow to Fate's decree,<br>
    Then no longer let us linger,<br>
    To the altar hurry we!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    (They all dance off two and two—Gianetta with Marco, Tessa with Giuseppe.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    (Flourish. A gondola arrives at the Piazzetta steps, from which<br>
    enter the Duke of Plaza-toro, the Duchess, their daughter<br>
    Casilda, and their attendant Luiz, who carries a drum. All are<br>
    dressed in pompous but old and faded clothes.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    (Entrance of Duke, Duchess, Casilda, and Luiz.)<br>
    </p>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> From the sunny Spanish shore,
    The Duke of Plaza-Tor!—<br>
    <h4>DUCH.</h4> And His Grace's Duchess true—<br>
    <h4>CAS.</h4> And His Grace's daughter, too—<br>
    <h4>LUIZ.</h4> And His Grace's private drum
    To Venetia's shores have come:<br>
    <h4>ALL.</h4> If ever, ever, ever<br>
    <p>
    They get back to Spain,<br>
    They will never, never, never<br>
    Cross the sea again—<br>
    </p>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> Neither that Grandee from the Spanish shore,<br>
    The noble Duke of Plaza-Tor'—<br>
    <h4>DUCH.</h4> Nor His Grace's Duchess, staunch and true—<br>
    <h4>CAS.</h4> You may add, His Grace's daughter, too—<br>
    <h4>LUIZ.</h4> Nor His Grace's own particular drum<br>
    To Venetia's shores will come:<br>
    <h4>ALL.</h4> If ever, ever, ever<br>
    <p>
    They get back to Spain,<br>
    They will never, never, never<br>
    Cross the sea again!<br>
    </p>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> At last we have arrived at our destination. This is<br>
    the Ducal Palace, and it is here that the Grand Inquisitor<br>
    resides. As a Castilian hidalgo of ninety-five quarterings, I<br>
    regret that I am unable to pay my state visit on a horse. As a<br>
    Castilian hidalgo of that description, I should have preferred to<br>
    ride through the streets of Venice; but owing, I presume, to an<br>
    unusually wet season, the streets are in such a condition that<br>
    equestrian exercise is impracticable. No matter. Where is our<br>
    suite?<br>
    <h4>LUIZ</h4> (coming forward). Your Grace, I am here.<br>
    <h4>DUCH.</h4> Why do you not do yourself the honour to kneel when<br>
    you address His Grace?<br>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> My love, it is so small a matter! (To Luiz.) Still,<br>
    you may as well do it. (Luiz kneels.)<br>
    <h4>CAS.</h4> The young man seems to entertain but an imperfect<br>
    appreciation of the respect due from a menial to a Castilian<br>
    hidalgo.<br>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> My child, you are hard upon our suite.<br>
    <h4>CAS.</h4> Papa, I've no patience with the presumption of persons<br>
    in his plebeian position. If he does not appreciate that<br>
    position, let him be whipped until he does.<br>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> Let us hope the omission was not intended as a<br>
    slight. I should be much hurt if I thought it was. So would he.<br>
    (To Luiz.) Where are the halberdiers who were to have had the<br>
    honour of meeting us here, that our visit to the Grand Inquisitor<br>
    might be made in becoming state?<br>
    <h4>LUIZ.</h4> Your Grace, the halberdiers are mercenary people who<br>
    stipulated for a trifle on account.<br>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> How tiresome! Well, let us hope the Grand Inquisitor<br>
    is a blind gentleman. And the band who were to have had the<br>
    honour of escorting us? I see no band!<br>
    <h4>LUIZ.</h4> Your Grace, the band are sordid persons who required<br>
    to be paid in advance.<br>
    <h4>DUCH.</h4> That's so like a band!<br>
    <h4>DUKE </h4> (annoyed). Insuperable difficulties meet me at every
    turn!<br>
    <h4>DUCH.</h4> But surely they know His Grace?<br>
    <h4>LUIZ.</h4> Exactly—they know His Grace.<br>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> Well, let us hope that the Grand Inquisitor is a deaf<br>
    gentleman. A cornet-a-piston would be something. You do not<br>
    happen to possess the accomplishment of tootling like a<br>
    cornet-a-piston?<br>
    <h4>LUIZ.</h4> Alas, no, Your Grace! But I can imitate a farmyard.<br>
    <h4>DUKE </h4> (doubtfully). I don't see how that would help us. I<br>
    don't see how we could bring it in.<br>
    <h4>CAS.</h4> It would not help us in the least. We are not a<br>
    parcel of graziers come to market, dolt!<br>
    (Luiz rises.)<br>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> My love, our suite's feelings! (To Luiz.) Be so <br>
    good as to ring the bell and inform the Grand Inquisitor that his<br>
    Grace the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Count Matadoro, Baron Picadoro—<br>
    <h4>DUCH.</h4> And suite—<br>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> And suite—have arrived at Venice, and seek—<br>
    <h4>CAS.</h4> Desire—<br>
    <h4>DUCH.</h4> Demand!<br>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> And demand an audience.<br>
    <h4>LUIZ.</h4> Your Grace has but to command.<br>
    <h4>DUKE </h4> (much moved). I felt sure of it—I felt sure of it!<br>
    (Exit Luiz into Ducal Palace.) And now, my love—(aside to<br>
    Duchess) Shall we tell her? I think so—(aloud to Casilda) And<br>
    now, my love, prepare for a magnificent surprise. It is my<br>
    agreeable duty to reveal to you a secret which should make you<br>
    the happiest young lady in Venice!<br>
    <h4>CAS.</h4> A secret?<br>
    <h4>DUCH.</h4> A secret which, for State reasons, it has been
    necessary to preserve for twenty years.<br>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> When you were a prattling babe of six months old you<br>
    were married by proxy to no less a personage than the infant son<br>
    and heir of His Majesty the immeasurably wealthy King of<br>
    Barataria!<br>
    <h4>CAS.</h4> Married to the infant son of the King of Barataria?<br>
    Was I consulted? (Duke shakes his head.) Then it was a most<br>
    unpardonable liberty!<br>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> Consider his extreme youth and forgive him. Shortly<br>
    after the ceremony that misguided monarch abandoned the creed of<br>
    his forefathers, and became a Wesleyan Methodist of the most<br>
    bigoted and persecuting type. The Grand Inquisitor, determined<br>
    that the innovation should not be perpetuated in Barataria,<br>
    caused your smiling and unconscious husband to be stolen and<br>
    conveyed to Venice. A fortnight since the Methodist Monarch and<br>
    all his Wesleyan Court were killed in an insurrection, and we are<br>
    here to ascertain the whereabouts of your husband, and to hail<br>
    you, our daughter, as Her Majesty, the reigning Queen of<br>
    Barataria! (Kneels.)<br>
    <p>
    (During this speech Luiz re-enters.)<br>
    </p>
    <h4>DUCH.</h4> Your Majesty! (Kneels.) (Drum roll.)<br>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> It is at such moments as these that one feels how<br>
    necessary it is to travel with a full band.<br>
    <h4>CAS.</h4> I, the Queen of Barataria! But I've nothing to wear!<br>
    We are practically penniless!<br>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> That point has not escaped me. Although I am<br>
    unhappily in straitened circumstances at present, my social<br>
    influence is something enormous; and a Company, to be called the<br>
    Duke of Plaza-Toro, Limited, is in course of formation to work<br>
    me. An influential directorate has been secured, and I shall<br>
    myself join the Board after allotment.<br>
    <h4>CAS.</h4> Am I to understand that the Queen of Barataria may be<br>
    called upon at any time to witness her honoured sire in process<br>
    of liquidation?<br>
    <h4>DUCH.</h4> The speculation is not exempt from that drawback. If<br>
    your father should stop, it will, of course, be necessary to wind<br>
    him up.<br>
    <h4>CAS.</h4> But it's so undignified—it's so degrading! A Grandee<br>
    of Spain turned into a public company! Such a thing was never<br>
    heard of!<br>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> My child, the Duke of Plaza-Toro does not follow<br>
    fashions—he leads them. He always leads everybody. When he was<br>
    in the army he led his regiment. He occasionally led them into<br>
    action. He invariably led them out of it.<br>
    <h4>SONG—DUKE OF PLAZA-TORO.</h4>
    <p>
    In enterprise of martial kind,<br>
    When there was any fighting,<br>
    He led his regiment from behind—<br>
    He found it less exciting.<br>
    But when away his regiment ran,<br>
    His place was at the fore, O—<br>
    That celebrated,<br>
    Cultivated,<br>
    Underrated<br>
    Nobleman,<br>
    The Duke of Plaza-Toro!<br>
    </p>
    <h4>ALL.</h4> In the first and foremost flight, ha, ha!<br>
    <p>
    You always found that knight, ha, ha!<br>
    That celebrated,<br>
    Cultivated,<br>
    Underrated<br>
    Nobleman,<br>
    The Duke of Plaza-Toro!<br>
    </p>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> When, to evade Destruction's hand,<br>
    <p>
    To hide they all proceeded,<br>
    No soldier in that gallant band<br>
    Hid half as well as he did.<br>
    He lay concealed throughout the war,<br>
    And so preserved his gore, O!<br>
    That unaffected,<br>
    Undetected,<br>
    Well-connected<br>
    Warrior,<br>
    The Duke of Plaza-Toro!<br>
    </p>
    <h4>ALL.</h4> In every doughty deed, ha, ha!<br>
    <p>
    He always took the lead, ha, ha!<br>
    That unaffected,<br>
    Undetected,<br>
    Well-connected<br>
    Warrior,<br>
    The Duke of Plaza-Toro!<br>
    </p>
    <h4>DUKE.</h4> When told that they would all be shot<br>
    <p>
    Unless they left the service,<br>
    That hero hesitated not,<br>
    So marvellous his nerve is.<br>
    He sent his resignation in,<br>
    The first of all his corps, O!<br>
    That very knowing,<br>
    Overflowing,<br>
    Easy-going<br>
    Paladin,<br>
    The Duke of Plaza-Toro!<br>
    </p>
    <h4>ALL.</h4> To men of grosser clay, ha, ha!<br>
    <p>
    He always showed the way, ha, ha!<br>
    That very knowing,<br>
    Overflowing,<br>
    Easy-going<br>
    Paladin,<br>
    The Duke of Plaza-Toro!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    (Exeunt Duke and Duchess into Grand Ducal Palace. As soon as<br>
    they have disappeared, Luiz and Casilda rush to each other's<br>
    arms.)
